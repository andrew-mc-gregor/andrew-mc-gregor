<h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>

I'm an experienced renewable energy professional supporting the global energy transition using science-based, data-driven analysis. My expertise lies in building models of complex projects, extracting meaningful insights, and communicating these to stakeholders and management. 

I’m currently improving my optimisation skills using Python and learning about Systems Thinking. I’m open to collaborating on any projects related to the energy transition.
